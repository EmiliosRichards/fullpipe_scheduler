# Notes:
# 1. After installing these requirements, you must also run `playwright install`
#    to download the necessary browser binaries for Playwright.
# 2. If your IDE (e.g., VS Code with Pylance) shows errors like
#    "Import 'phonenumbers' could not be resolved" or for other packages,
#    ensure that:
#    a) You have activated the correct Python virtual environment where these
#       packages were installed.
#    b) Your IDE is configured to use that virtual environment's Python interpreter.
#    c) You have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in that environment.
