Hi, I have had a little time for research again! 
I found this: https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/ 
you can filter it for Austrian, german and Swiss startups  so maybe it can filer that. 
After this ill quickly fix 2 thing in a pitch and then ill send you more sites and continue the research.
EU-Startups Database
The startup database of the most promising startups in Europe. Where you can find the data and information about startups in Germany, UK, France, and all around Europe.
 

Hi, I'm back doing research!
Ill send you a few Links I come across. I might edit this message later when I find new ones.
